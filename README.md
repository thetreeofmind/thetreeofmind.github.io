## Hosting
This repo is hosted via github pages. Manual configuration is done in the repo settings, to point github pages to serve content from /docs folder from the `main` branch of the repo.

A new commit to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment to the site automatically.

Therefore, make sure all compiled static js, css, html files are in /docs folder, and committed into source control
